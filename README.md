### Store Simulator

This is group project developed for the "Softwaere Engineering" course at the "Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze".
The aim is to demonstrate a series of software engineering skills, from the use of the UML language for class, flow and use case diagrams, to implementation and testing.

The program simulates a web store that allows the client to select and purchase a number of products, it then proceeds to simulate the process of delivering and tracking of the selected goods.
This is all just a dummy: there is no database, no server, no website and it is all written in Java, the project only served as an excuse to practice software engineering.
